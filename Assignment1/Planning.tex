\section{Plan and schedule the necessary activities} 

% TODO:
All activities must be broken down in smaller bit in a Plan-Driven.
This is due to a static hardware setup and no customer to interact with.
\\
\\
The following must be included as activities:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Validate user requirements
	\item Software design
	\begin{itemize}
		\item HW/SW interfaces
		\item Software architecture
		\item Display driver
		\item Projector driver
		\item Clock and alarm driver
		\item Sound driver
		\item Button driver
	\end{itemize}
	\item Software implementation
	\item Test specification
	\item Integration
	\item Acceptance test
	\item User manual
\end{enumerate}

In Figure \ref{fig:activityPlanning} all the activities are shown with estimated duration and interdependencies. Each activity is given a unique identifier in the top-left box, and a estimated duration in the top-right box. The four middle boxes shows the first and last start and stop times in weeks. The lower-left box shows time available for each activity and the lower-right box shows the slack available slack time. It is easy to find the critical path, by following the activities with zero slack time.
