\section{What are the risks and how do you deal with them?}

\subsection{Project risks} % (fold)
\label{sub:project_risks}

The major project risks are related to illness/sick-leave.
Several employees involved with the development has small children, which are more likely to become sick and require a developer to stay home.

Also, as development is set to start in September and run through fall, winter and spring, flu-season and the related increase in sick-day frequency will factor into the expected availability of workers.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Kids -- should they get sick they need parental care.
	\item Sick days for all team members.
	\item Team members quiting the job.
	\item New tools makes people quit.
	\item Software scares the hardware designer away.
	\item Competing products are released before this product.
	\item Nobody wants to buy a clock -- people has smart phones\dots
\end{enumerate}
To deal with these risk, the company creates a probability and assessment analysis:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1] Each member with kids are assigned to tasks which are given longer time to finish.
	\item[2] Flu season will hit along with common sickness ordinary people tends to catch.
	\item[3] Make documentation on the fly.
	\item[4] Make time for getting to know the new tools.
	\item[5a] The hardware designer must not be set to develop trivial software
	\item[5b] Offer the hardware designer classes in software development
	\item[6] Don't get delayed.
	\item[7] Marketing problem.
\end{itemize}
