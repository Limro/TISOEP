\section{It is important that you are on time. 
	Otherwise the company is expected to suffer substantial financial loss. 
	Which work could you sacrifice in order to meet the deadline in case unexpected delays occur?}

Since this is a product created with hardware, the amount of functionalities to sacrifice are quite few.
However, a few can be done differently to save time. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Projector show different time than the clock
	\item[] By remove the part where the projector always show the current time and replaces it with what's on the display instead, the developers can use the same module for time on the display driver and the projector driver.

	\item Stroboscope can be removed
	\item[] The need of a stroboscope fashion projected time can be removed to just showing the time without the stroboscope effect.

	\item Repeat can be removed.
	\item[] The alarm has a repeat button which functionality is not essential for the device to work. This could be removed and the alarm will only sound once.
\end{itemize}
